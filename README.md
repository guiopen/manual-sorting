# manual-sorting
A very simple sorting algorithim made in python

I created it as a school homework, the idea is to go through the list and compare the current element with all the previous elements, moving backward until it reaches an element smaller than itself. This way, instead of traversing the entire list in each iteration, the algorithm ends up traversing only about 1/3 on average.
